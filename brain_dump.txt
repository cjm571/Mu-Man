Goals:
1. Submit something that works (even if it's simple and sucks)
2. Don't Suck
3. ...
4. Profit!

Python Stuff:
1. primary processor sim that keeps track of the state and asks the mu-man and ghost "objects" what their move will be
2. ghost classes to play against. these can be as simple or complex as we want, as we don't need to compile them
3. Mu-Man- this needs to be written as simply as possible as it needs to be compiled (which will basically just be a fancy copy/paste that we mostly hardcode)

Mu-Man Ideas:
We will use a heuristic search to determine moves.

As discussed, we will use our "magnetism" concept to determine the best move.

Certain things will have attractive properties (fruit, power pills, normal pills) and repulsive properties (ghosts). The closer and more important the are, the stronger the attraction (or repulsion).

We can use DFS to find the best path to important things. We will incorporate this into the heuristic by boosting the value of that move.

Iteration Ideas:
1. Write all the python for the game world and the ghosts
2. Write Mu-Man
   - Initially very simple: greedy algorithm, ignore ghosts
3. Write compiler
4. Iterate on Mu-Man
    - Add better attraction for important things
    - Add higher scores for closely grouped things
    - Actively evade ghosts
    - Predict ghost movement
    - adversarial search if necessary?
